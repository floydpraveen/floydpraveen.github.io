Hi,

I'm Praveen Kumar, a software engineer from India currently living in Berlin.

JavaScript & Ruby are my favourite programming languages. I like exploring Open-source libraries and learn from other programmers out there. 
Reading some of their blogs inspired to me create this one for myself so I can write my learnings here.

You can reach out to me at praveen (dot) kumar at hey.com
 or [twitter][2] or collaborate with me on [github][3] or share your inspirational quote about life with me on [linkedin][4] :D
