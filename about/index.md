Hi, 

I'm Praveen, a software engineer from Bangalore.
I work at [unbxd][1], a e-commerce search/recommendation platform startup.   
 
JavaScript & Ruby are my favourite programming languages. I like exploring Open-source libraries and learn from other programmers out there. Reading some of their blogs inspired to me create this one for myself.  

You can reach out to me at **pdnsjce@gmail.com**
 or [twitter][2] or colleberate with me on [github][3]
