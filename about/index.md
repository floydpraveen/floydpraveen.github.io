Hi, 

I'm Praveen Kumar, a software engineer currently living in Berlin.  
I work at an automotive startup as a frontend engineer.
Previously I worked at [unbxd][1], an e-commerce search/recommendation platform startup.  

JavaScript & Ruby are my favourite programming languages. I like exploring Open-source libraries and learn from other programmers out there. Reading some of their blogs inspired to me create this one for myself so I can write my learnings here.  

You can reach out to me at pdn (dot) sjce at gmail.com
 or [twitter][2] or collaborate with me on [github][3] or share your inspirational quote about life with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/praveen612) :D
